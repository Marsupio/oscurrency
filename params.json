{"name":"Oscurrency","body":"### Welcome to oscurrency.\r\nThis project helps small communities match unmet needs with available resources.  Installation on heroku is simple:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/oscurrency/oscurrency.git\r\n$ edit config/config.yml\r\n$ script/heroku_install\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're a developer interested in contributed to the latest, there is a rails31 branch and more.\r\n\r\n### OpenTransact\r\nFor interoperability, oscurrency speaks the OpenTransact protocol.  For instance, payments can be made from a cell phone.\r\n\r\n### Lots of web admin tricks\r\nFrom San Francisco to Athens, Greece, this project has adapted and grown to support moderately sized communities with multiple roles and admin tricks.\r\n\r\n### Internationalization\r\nLanguages supported include Greek, French, Spanish and English.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2008, Michael Hartl (@mhartl) created insoshi.  The groups feature came from a fork by Ruben Gomez (@yuki).  In September 2008, insoshi was forked by oscurrency maintainer Tom Brown (@herestomwiththeweather) and Rich Vazquez (@drapetomaniac).  In 2009-2010, heroku support was added by Lee Azzarello (@lazzarello) and Mike Travers (@mtravers). In 2011, internationalization and various admin tools were added by Vasili Revelas (@3point2), Thanasis Peppas (@thanasispeppas) and John Salatas (@jsalatas).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with oscurrency?
